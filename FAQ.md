# Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I start with video or image set?
The image sets are sampled frames from the video. We provide it because many off-the-shelf reconstruction systems cannot directly take videos as input. For beginners, start with image sets. You can also refer to [this tutorial page](https://tanksandtemples.org/tutorial/) for instructions on how to setup a workable system. For advanced users, please work with the videos since they are the raw 4K videos we captured with a high end camera.

### I cannot run the python scripts
The python scripts run on Python 2.7 or 3.x. Older versions of python are not supported. For python 2.7, the ``requests`` package is needed. You can install it with the following command:
```
sudo pip install requests
```
